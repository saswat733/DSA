Certainly! Depth First Search (DFS) is a classic algorithm used to traverse or search through the nodes of a graph. Hereâ€™s an explanation of the DFS algorithm with a commented code example in C++:

### Depth First Search (DFS)

#### Key Concepts:
- **Traversal Method**: DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This is done by using recursion or a stack data structure.
- **Starting Point**: DFS begins at a starting node and explores each branch before moving to the next node.
- **Use Case**: DFS is useful for pathfinding, topological sorting, and detecting cycles in graphs.

#### Properties:
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for the recursion stack or an explicit stack.

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Mark the current node as visited**.
2. **Explore all the adjacent nodes** of the current node that are not visited by calling the DFS function recursively.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
    // A private helper function to perform DFS recursively
    private:
    void dfs(int node, vector<int> adj[], int vis[], vector<int> &ls) {
        // Mark the current node as visited
        vis[node] = 1;
        // Add the current node to the result list
        ls.push_back(node);

        // Traverse all the adjacent nodes of the current node
        for(auto it : adj[node]) {
            // If the adjacent node has not been visited, perform DFS on it
            if(!vis[it]) {
                dfs(it, adj, vis, ls);
            }
        }
    }

    public:
    // Function to return a list containing the DFS traversal of the graph
    vector<int> dfsOfGraph(int V, vector<int> adj[]) {
        // Array to keep track of visited nodes, initialized to 0 (not visited)
        int vis[V] = {0};
        // List to store the DFS traversal result
        vector<int> ls;

        // Starting the DFS from node 0 (assuming 0 as the starting point)
        int start = 0;
        dfs(start, adj, vis, ls);

        // Return the DFS traversal result
        return ls;
    }
};

// Helper function to add an edge to the graph
void addEdge(vector<int> adj[], int u, int v) {
    adj[u].push_back(v);
    adj[v].push_back(u); // For undirected graph; omit this line for directed graph
}

int main() {
    // Number of vertices
    int V = 5;
    // Graph represented as an adjacency list
    vector<int> adj[V];

    // Adding edges to the graph
    addEdge(adj, 0, 1);
    addEdge(adj, 0, 2);
    addEdge(adj, 1, 3);
    addEdge(adj, 2, 4);

    // Create a Solution object and perform DFS
    Solution obj;
    vector<int> result = obj.dfsOfGraph(V, adj);

    // Print the DFS traversal result
    for (int i : result) {
        cout << i << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - The graph is represented using an adjacency list. `vector<int> adj[]` stores the adjacent nodes for each vertex.

2. **Helper Function (`dfs`)**:
   - This is a recursive function that performs the DFS traversal.
   - It takes the current node (`node`), the adjacency list (`adj`), the visited array (`vis`), and the result list (`ls`) as parameters.
   - It marks the current node as visited and adds it to the result list.
   - It then recursively visits all the adjacent nodes that have not been visited.

3. **Main Function (`dfsOfGraph`)**:
   - This function initializes the visited array and result list.
   - It starts the DFS traversal from node 0 (or any other starting node).
   - It returns the result list containing the DFS traversal.

4. **Graph Construction**:
   - The `addEdge` function adds an edge between two nodes in the graph.

5. **Main Execution**:
   - The graph is constructed using the `addEdge` function.
   - The DFS traversal is performed using the `dfsOfGraph` function.
   - The result of the DFS traversal is printed.

This implementation covers the essential concepts of DFS and how it can be used to traverse a graph.

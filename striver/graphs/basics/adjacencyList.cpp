### Building an Adjacency List for an Undirected Graph

#### Function Definition
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> printGraph(int V, vector<pair<int,int>> edges) {
    vector<vector<int>> adj_list(V);
    
    for (auto edge : edges) {
        int u = edge.first;
        int v = edge.second;
        
        adj_list[u].push_back(v);
        adj_list[v].push_back(u);
    }
    
    return adj_list;
}
```

#### Key Information

1. **Purpose**:
   - The function constructs an adjacency list for an undirected graph given the number of vertices and a list of edges.
   - It returns the adjacency list representation of the graph.

2. **Parameters**:
   - `int V`: The number of vertices in the graph.
   - `vector<pair<int,int>> edges`: A vector of pairs, where each pair represents an edge between two vertices `u` and `v`.

3. **Returns**:
   - `vector<vector<int>>`: The adjacency list of the graph, where each index represents a vertex and contains a list of its adjacent vertices.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - **Initialization**: Create a vector of vectors `adj_list` with `V` empty vectors, one for each vertex.
   - **Populate Adjacency List**: Iterate through each edge in the `edges` vector.
     - For each edge, add vertex `v` to the adjacency list of vertex `u` and vice versa to account for the undirected nature of the graph.
   - **Return Adjacency List**: After populating, return the adjacency list.

#### Complexity Analysis

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - **Initialization**: Initializing the adjacency list takes O(V) time.
   - **Edge Insertion**: Each edge is processed once, resulting in O(E) time for inserting all edges, where `E` is the number of edges.
   - Overall Time Complexity: **O(V + E)**.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - **Adjacency List Storage**: The adjacency list requires O(V + E) space, as it stores a list for each vertex and all edges.
   - Overall Space Complexity: **O(V + E)**.

#### Key Points for Interviews

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The function converts an edge list representation of a graph into an adjacency list representation, which is often used for efficient graph traversal algorithms like BFS and DFS.

2. **Handling Undirected Graphs**:
   - Ensure that each edge is added bidirectionally to account for the undirected nature of the graph. This is done by adding vertex `v` to `u`'s list and vice versa.

3. **Efficiency Considerations**:
   - The algorithm is efficient with a time complexity of O(V + E), suitable for most practical purposes.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Consider cases with no edges or isolated nodes. The function should handle these gracefully, returning an adjacency list with empty lists for vertices with no connections.

### Annotated Code

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> printGraph(int V, vector<pair<int,int>> edges) {
    vector<vector<int>> adj_list(V);  // Initialize adjacency list with V empty vectors
    
    for (auto edge : edges) {  // Iterate through each edge
        int u = edge.first;
        int v = edge.second;
        
        adj_list[u].push_back(v);  // Add v to u's list
        adj_list[v].push_back(u);  // Add u to v's list (since the graph is undirected)
    }
    
    return adj_list;  // Return the populated adjacency list
}
```
